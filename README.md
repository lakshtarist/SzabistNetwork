# SzabistNetwork
As part of the DCCN (Data Communication and Computer Networks) course, I led the design and implementation of a robust networking infrastructure for the SZABIST Karachi campus, covering multiple departments across seven buildings. The project required creating a detailed network topology using VLANs for efficient network management, while implementing Inter-VLAN routing where necessary. Each building, including classrooms, labs, and administrative offices, was integrated into the network, with careful allocation of IP pools using VLSM for optimized resource utilization.

I configured and deployed a DHCP server to assign IP addresses dynamically, ensuring seamless connectivity across the campus. Key services, such as printers, servers, and faculty resources, were statically assigned IPs for efficient management. Port security measures were implemented for the protection of lab devices and servers, and NAT was enabled on the edge router to connect the entire campus network to the internet. Access Control Lists (ACLs) were employed to limit access to critical resources, such as Zabdesk and faculty printers, based on defined access permissions.

The project also involved configuring remote management protocols, enabling secure remote access to switches and routers from anywhere on campus. Security protocols, including password protection for all network devices (console, Telnet, and privileged mode), were implemented to safeguard the network. The final network design ensured that all devices across the seven buildings, including PCs, servers, and printers, were properly connected, secured, and manageable remotely.
